The collection of municipal solid waste is one of the most
difficult operational problems faced by local authorities in
any city. In recent years, due to a number of cost, health, and
environmental concerns, many municipalities, particularly
in industrialized nations, have been forced to assess their
solid waste management and examine its cost-effectiveness
and environmental impacts.
The result is that both private and municipal haulers are giving serious
consideration to new technologies such as computerized
vehicle routing software.Waste is located in containers along
the streets of a defined road network. The containers must be
collected by a fleet of compactor trucks.
Each waste container is equipped with sensors that measure the weight of the refuse stored in the container
Different types of municipal solid waste are
collected separately, and furthermore there are separate
containers for each waste type.
Each vehicle can typically
collect refuse from several hundreds of waste bins before
going to the waste disposal site to unload. 
The amount of municipal
solid waste is highly variable and the accumulation of waste
depend on several factors such as the number of inhabitants
sharing a container, GDP per capita, lifestyle, time of the
year, etc. Therefore, the considered waste collection
problem is stochastic by nature.
In this study, the average
accumulation rate of waste in each container type is
estimated separately using the historical weight and route.
The compactor truck daily collects waste from the public waste pits. Different types of waste pits have been installed for different purposes.
The objective is to schedule the
collection activities and to minimize the total distance
travelled by the collection vehicles within each day.
ThankYou.
